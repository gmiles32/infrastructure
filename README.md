# Infrastructure
This is how I manage my homelab setup with Ansible. This repo is a WIP, but the goal is to have my configuration public in a secure way, taking advantage of secret management with `ansible-vault`. Some configs are missing, but I will document how to make these for your setup.

# TODO
- [ ] Need to document how to run docker containers after generating compose
- [ ] Add playbook for mass start up/spin down of docker containers
- [ ] Add PVE reboot playbook
- [X] Add firewalld configuration to work with docker
- [X] Add renovate bot to repository for updating docker images
